				<h2>ComplimentKarma Guidelines</h2>
				<p>
				ComplimentKarma is a Professional, Social network with the goal of bringing more positivity and satisfaction to everyone’s professional and personal life. In order to achieve these goals we all need to adhere to these guidelines, as well as ComplimentKarma's Terms of Service.</p>
				<h3>Compliment Etiquette</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Be responsible and never ask for compliments from others. A compliment is an internal calling for the sender. It’s like saying “Thank You”, “Good job”, “Kudos” etc. On day to day basis, you should try to do a great job in all aspects of your work and personal life and be considerate of others, so that they themselves feel like you deserve to get their compliments.</li>
					<li>Never ask for or send a fake compliment. A real compliment will convey a real and satisfying feeling of earning something you deserve. In the end this is all about good Karma and fairness.</li>
					<li>Be respectful to others and never spam or harass anybody.</li>
					<li>Never write/share your Employer’s confidential information in any section such as Comments etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>What we ask of you</h3>
				<h4>Employees</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>On an average, please send at-least 7 compliments a week, to any deserving coworker or other professional contact who helped you in some way, to do your job well. 
			Example: Send compliments for Customer Service, Project Management, Web Design, Accounting and Easy to Work With etc skills.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Employers</h4>
