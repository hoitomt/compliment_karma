Being in IT for years, I myself shared Aman's sentiment about the need to bring positivity to every workplace. I really liked the idea of using meaningful gamification, in devising the solution. From day 1 our goal has been to provide real tangible benefits to our users, instead of just fluff.

Being a Business Intelligence Consultant, I have worked with various companies in different verticals. During my career, I have had the opportunity to work and learn from lots of amazingly smart and dedicated colleagues, which has helped me grow professionally and as a human being. This venture is my effort to give back to all those people and bring more positivity to every work culture. The main goal of this site is to tremendously increase your job satisfaction and quickly deliver real tangible benefits, while taking the least amount of your precious time.

<b>Why we started ComplimentKarma?</b><br/>
<font style="font-size:15px;">
While working in different companies, we noticed that on day to day basis whenever employees help each other with a problem or task, they usually send an email, IM or just swing by each otherís desk to thank them, for the help they provided. Although this nice gesture of complimenting each other really make us feel good that coworkers appreciate our work, and provides a confirmation that we do add some value which helps others, but other than conveying this good feeling for a few moments these compliments donít really do much after that. These remain locked in the email or messenger waiting to be archived and never reach their full potential. Now think about the thousands of compliments earned by a professional like you, over the course of professional career.
<br/><br/>
More we discussed about this problem, more potential benefits we found waiting to be unlocked, by solving it. That is when we came up with the idea of ComplimentKarma.com. We thought what if we give all professionals a way to compliment each other. Not just a compliment but a quantifiable social compliment which stays with them forever, irrespective of the place they work at, and starts helping them immediately by letting them Earn Reputation, Cash Rewards and build long term Proof of Experience.

<br/><br/>
<b>Problems we want to solve</b><br/>
<font style="font-size:15px;">
<li>Thousands of compliments and thank you messages earned by professionals over the course of their professional careers stay locked in their emails and messengers, waiting to be archived and never reaching their full potential
</li>
<li>Most reward system put in place by companies are totally closed applications, that do not let employees take away their earned compliments and reputation with them, when they switch jobs, which prevents them from building their proof of experience. It also prevents employers from reaching an easy and reliable means of verifying a candidateís experience.
</li>
<li>Need a means to ease off steam and break the ice, to pave way for a more positive work culture
</li>
<li>Employee satisfaction is a huge metric which is totally ignored in many workplaces. Most importance is paid at sales, customer satisfaction and retention etc, but never on the employeeís satisfaction that directly drives all aspects of business including sales and customer service etc
</li>
<li>Many times, employees who go out of their way to help others don't get much in return, or at least nothing strong enough to help them with their careers, reputation or provide a monetary value
</li>
<li>Companies don't have a easy way of finding and rewarding the employees who add extra value to their company productivity and work culture
</li>
<li>Hiring managers have problem in verifying the skill set and experience for potential candidates during hiring process
</li>
<li>A perfect resume may not be enough to really validate what are the most solid skills of a professional
</li>
<li>Some candidates have tough time in conveying to hiring managers about what they have done during their past jobs and how can that be applied at the new job, which may sometimes be due to candidates not having good enough sales skills
</li>
<li>Phone reference checks sometimes may not be that reliable
</li>
